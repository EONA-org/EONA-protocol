EONA Protocol

EONA Protocol defines the rules of existence for a person who chooses freedom-based identity outside their national identity.

The protocol is not a legal document.
It is a social contract between the individual and the EONA network.

⸻

Principles
	1.	Self-created identity
A human can create an identity without permission from a state.
	2.	Zero hierarchy
No government, company or institution can own a human identity.
	3.	Decentralized verification
Identity is verified by human relationships and proof-of-existence, not by passport.
	4.	Inheritance of identity
A person’s identity can be inherited, extended and authenticated even when displaced.
	5.	Cross-border continuity
Identity cannot be removed by geography.
	6.	Freedom before citizenship
Citizenship is an option, not a condition of existence.
